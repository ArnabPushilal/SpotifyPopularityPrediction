# Motivation
Just in the past year I had released 2 songs on spotify. As far as marketing went I felt it just bounced around my friends and back. As I forayed into Data Science, I realized that Spotify analyzes each track & assigns it a score.  So what my main motive was to see if my song 'lacked' in some elements according to spotify. To do this I wanted to create a model which would predict the popularity score assigned by spotify for an unknown track.
